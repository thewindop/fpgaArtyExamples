This design is a base to experiment with various sensors. It was created using IPI and the board file
and constraints are in the HW directory.

Several examples are contained within the FW directory. All were derived from examples supplied with Vivado SDK.
See www.canoboard.com for details on each.

A TCL build script and windows bat Vivado laucher are also included. Dependent on where you install Vivado and locate
these examples the base paths in both scripts will need to be updated.

Ensure you have loaded the Arty board file as per instructions on https://reference.digilentinc.com/arty. Further help and tutorials can also be found here.
